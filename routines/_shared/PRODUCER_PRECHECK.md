## Why this exists

Wall-clock staggers put producers before consumers on a normal day, but a slow
producer (long run, retry, API latency) or a missed run (app closed) breaks that.
History: producers silently stopped for ~3 weeks and consumers kept emitting
fresh-dated CRITICALs from stale data. The freshness gate caught *old* data;
it did not catch *same-day-not-yet-produced* or *unchanged* data. These three
pre-checks close that gap. **Skip is always better than stale.**

## 1. Producer pre-check (run FIRST, before any work)

> **`{date}` BASIS — DECLARED, NON-OPTIONAL (DOC-36, declared 2026-07-31).**
> Every `{date}` / `{today}` in a **filename, report heading, or glob** is the
> **LOCAL date** — `Australia/Brisbane`, **UTC+10, no DST** (so the offset is
> constant year-round). It is NOT the UTC date.
>
> Every **timestamp** — `run_id`, `output_produced_at`, `scan_completed_utc`,
> exit-log rows — stays **UTC ISO-8601 with `Z`**. Date labels are local,
> timestamps are UTC; they are different fields and neither substitutes for the
> other. Deriving a date label by truncating a UTC timestamp is the bug.
>
> **Why it is not cosmetic.** Local is UTC+10, so from **14:00Z to 24:00Z**
> (00:00–10:00 local) the two bases name different days. A routine labelling on
> the wrong basis writes an artifact its own consumers cannot glob; they read the
> producer as dark and emit a well-formed, contract-compliant SKIP while the
> input sits on disk under the adjacent day's name. Observed live:
> `documentation-sync` SKIPped at 2026-07-30T21:46Z, six minutes before
> `repo-scanner` produced the input it needed under the UTC label.
>
> **Stamp it.** Every dated artifact carries `date_basis: LOCAL (UTC+10)` in its
> header block, beside the clock-verification line.
>
> **Transition rule — glob BOTH bases until the corpus is uniform.** Artifacts
> written before 2026-07-31 use both (~854 local / ~34 UTC as measured
> 2026-07-31). Before committing `PRODUCER_NOT_YET_FIRED` or any "not produced
> today" SKIP, glob the producer under **both** `{local-date}` **and**
> `{local-date − 1}`. If the older label was written during the current local
> day, it IS today's artifact — consume it, and record the basis mismatch as a
> finding rather than skipping. Never commit such a SKIP without having globbed
> both. This rule composes with — does not replace — step 2a below.

For each entry in your `required_inputs` (from routine-schedule.json):

1. Stat the expected same-day file (e.g. `D:\reports\security\security-review-{today}.md`).
2. **If absent** (the producer hasn't run today): do NOT synthesize *yet* — but do NOT
   commit the SKIP on this run-start observation alone. Apply 2a/2b first.
   - **2a. Re-stat is UNCONDITIONAL and mtime-based (PE-22 / AI-46, 2026-07-21).**
     Immediately before committing ANY SKIP that asserts a required input is "not
     produced today" — regardless of whether any reasoning happened between run-start
     and here — glob the real expected path (e.g. `D:\reports\<producer>\*-{today}.md`),
     read its on-disk mtime, and RECORD that glob + mtime in the SKIP `skip_reason`.
     **If the file exists, do NOT SKIP-as-blackout** — consume it (fall through to
     step 3), or emit `PRODUCER_NOT_YET_FIRED` (2b) and re-fire on the next window. A
     `run_id` of `T00:00:00Z` (placeholder midnight fire) is itself a mandatory
     re-check trigger — a consumer that fired before its producer MUST re-stat/re-fire,
     never SKIP-as-blackout off the previous-cycle baseline. A run-start "absent" that
     a later stat contradicts MUST NOT drive a SKIP. *(Root cause of the 2026-07-12
     four-consumer false-blackout + QA-90 false escalation + severed learning loop: the
     prior conditional wording — "if real reasoning happened between run-start and
     here" — was never reached by a midnight-fire-then-immediate-SKIP.)*
   - **2b. Distinguish `PRODUCER_NOT_YET_FIRED` from a dark day.** If the producer is
     *expected today* (it has a same-window entry in `fleet-expectations.json`) but has
     not yet fired, emit `SKIP: PRODUCER_NOT_YET_FIRED (<name>)` and expect a re-fire on
     a later window — this is a boundary/ordering race (e.g. consumer @16:10 vs producer
     mtime @16:11:14), NOT a missed run. Only emit `SKIP: not produced today` when the
     producer is genuinely dark (no fire expected or long-overdue). Set `skip_reason`
     accordingly so `fleet-health-routine` can tell a transient race from an outage.
   - After 2a/2b, if still absent: write the structured exit record (§4) and STOP. You
     will be picked up on the next window once the producer runs (or on catch-up).
3. **If present:** continue to the freshness gate (`INPUT_FRESHNESS_GATE.md`) for
   age-tiering, then proceed.

Exception: producers (L0) and routines whose primary signal is live ground truth
(git state, web search, on-disk inventory) have no `required_inputs` and skip §1.

## 1.5 Self-prime the ROOT producer (repo-health only)

`PRODUCER_NOT_YET_FIRED` (§2b) plus a re-fire is enough when a *later window*
exists in the same run window. It is NOT enough on a serial catch-up boot where
the scheduler drains missed jobs in an order that puts `repo-scanner` **last**
(proven: `fleet-exit-log.jsonl` 2026-07-18 — `ceo`/`cto` skipped 3–6 min before
`repo-scanner` produced): the consumer's "next window" is then tomorrow, and the
whole day is lost.

So for the **root producer only** — the missing input is
`repo-health/portfolio-summary-{today}.md` AND the exit log shows no
`repo-scanner` `OK` row for today — a consumer MAY prime it instead of skipping:

1. **Lock.** If `D:\reports\repo-health\.prime.lock` exists and is <20 min old,
   another primer is already scanning — poll for `portfolio-summary-{today}.md`
   every 30s for up to 12 min; if it appears, consume it (→ §3, freshness gate).
   If the lock is stale or the window elapses, reclaim it. Otherwise create it
   (write your `run_id` + UTC).
2. **Prime once.** Run the `repo-scanner` routine
   (`C:\Users\alexa\.claude\scheduled-tasks\repo-scanner\SKILL.md`) as a subagent;
   wait for it to finish; delete the lock.
3. **Re-stat.** If `portfolio-summary-{today}.md` now exists with a real
   `scan_completed_utc:` beacon → proceed FRESH (§3). If it still doesn't →
   genuine producer failure: emit `SKIP: PRODUCER_NOT_YET_FIRED (repo-scanner)`
   (not a hard blackout) and STOP.

Notes:
- **Root producer only.** For any *non-root* missing input (security-review,
  cto-review, etc.) do NOT self-prime — fall through to §2a/2b as before. The
  root scan is the one input every consumer shares, so priming it once (under the
  lock) is cheap and unblocks the whole chain; priming arbitrary mid-chain
  producers would duplicate synthesis and race.
- This is the same lock/mechanism the manual `fleet-refresh` runner uses, so a
  self-priming consumer and an operator-triggered `fleet-refresh` coordinate
  rather than double-scan.
- Self-priming is a fallback for the boot race. The clean path for an operator's
  daytime dev burst is to run `fleet-refresh` explicitly (see its SKILL) before
  kicking consumers, rather than relying on each consumer to self-prime.

## 2. Catch-up rule (after a dark day)

The scheduler runs missed jobs on next launch. Do NOT backfill missed dates.

- If your newest output file is dated **before today**, you are catching up:
  produce **exactly ONE** run dated today.
- Lead the report with `catch_up: true, missed_days: N`.
- Combined with §1, a catch-up launch drains producer→consumer in order: producers
  run, consumers that pre-checked an absent input simply SKIP that pass and succeed
  on the next, instead of all firing at once on stale data.

## 3. NO_CHANGE pre-check (quiet-day skip — for change-driven routines)

For routines marked `cadence: condition` or `quiet_day_aware`, or any consumer whose
producer's output is unchanged:

1. Compare your producer's input against your last run (file hash, or the
   `repo-scanner` `history.jsonl` delta, or the canonical source file mtime/hash).
2. **If unchanged since your last run:** emit `SKIP: NO_CHANGE (<input> unchanged
   since {last_run})`, write the exit record, and reuse the prior findings. Do not
   re-synthesize identical conclusions.
3. **Quiet-day-aware governance routines** (ceo, approval-governance): do not skip
   outright — emit a SHORT "quiet day" report noting which producers skipped, so the
   operator still gets a daily heartbeat without a full synthesis.

## 4. Structured exit record (every routine, every run)

As the LAST step, append ONE line to `D:\reports\evolution\fleet-exit-log.jsonl`:

```json
{"routine_id":"<id>","run_id":"<ISO-utc>","exit_status":"OK|SKIP|ABORT|FAIL","input_freshness":"FRESH|DEGRADE|ABORT|NA","output_produced_at":"<ISO-utc-or-null>","catch_up":false,"skip_reason":null,"consecutive_failures":0}
```

- `routine_id` MUST equal the scheduled-task directory name (e.g.
  `innovation-backlog-routine`, never a short form like `innovation-backlog`).
  Consumers (`fleet-health-routine`) treat known historical aliases
  (`innovation-backlog` → `innovation-backlog-routine`) as the same routine for
  old rows; new rows must use the canonical id.
- `OK` = did real work. `SKIP` = correctly declined (§1/§2/§3 — NOT a failure;
  do not increment failure counters). `ABORT` = upstream too stale (freshness gate).
  `FAIL` = own logic/validation error.
- A row with `exit_status:OK` but `input_freshness:ABORT` is the dangerous
  "succeeded on bad data" case — the `fleet-health-routine` surfaces it.

## 5. Circuit-breaker convention (bounded retry)

State file: `D:\state\fleet-breakers.json` (sibling of `handoff-contract.json`).

- The existing validator FAIL→re-emit loop is capped: **max 2 re-emits per run**.
  On the 3rd consecutive validator FAIL, stop, emit `FAIL`, and increment
  `consecutive_failures` for your routine in `fleet-breakers.json`.
- **Trip:** `consecutive_failures ≥ 3` → set `tripped:true`. A tripped routine on
  its next fire emits `SKIP: breaker tripped (Nx)` and does no work until a human
  resets it (the `fleet-health-routine` surfaces trips).
- **Transient ≠ structural:** input-not-ready / network 403 / producer-absent is a
  **SKIP**, never a FAIL — do not increment the counter (else a dark day trips half
  the fleet). Only own-output validation failures and own logic errors increment.
- **Self-heal:** any `OK` run resets `consecutive_failures` to 0.
